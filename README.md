All Food acts like a glitchy hearthstone. Configurable chance to teleport when eating food.

```
Can be installed on the sever to enforce config and mod. 
If the mod is installed on the server, the client must have the mod, or they will be kicked for a version mismatch.

NOTE: This mod uses ServerSync and a File watcher. Changes to the server config file will sync to clients, no server reboot needed.
      Changes via the BepInEx Configuration Manager by an admin will change the server config and sync to all clients. (Admin must be in game)

### Made at the request of `Kysen#6031` on discord.

> ## Installation Instructions
***You must have BepInEx installed correctly! I can not stress this enough.***

#### Windows (Steam)

1. Locate your game folder manually or start Steam client and :
    * Right click the Valheim game in your steam library
    * "Go to Manage" -> "Browse local files"
    * Steam should open your game folder
2. Extract the contents of the archive into the BepInEx\plugins folder.
3. Locate Azumatt.HearthyFood.cfg under BepInEx\config and configure the mod to your needs

#### Server

`Must be installed on both the client and the server for syncing to work properly.`

1. Locate your main folder manually and :
   * Extract the contents of the archive into the BepInEx\plugins folder.
   * Launch your game at least once to generate the config file needed if you haven't already done so.
   * Locate Azumatt.HearthyFood.cfg under BepInEx\config on your machine and configure the mod to your needs
2. Reboot your server. All clients will now sync to the server's config file even if theirs differs.

`Feel free to reach out to me on discord if you need manual download assistance.`
